A 3090 RTX is an excellent choice for deep learning! Here are the key components you'll need to complete your budget-conscious deep learning rig:

**Processor (CPU)**
- Aim for a mid-range CPU like an Intel i5 12th/13th gen or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X/7600X
- Deep learning is primarily GPU-dependent, so you don't need the most expensive CPU

**Motherboard**
- Get a motherboard with PCIe 4.0 support for your 3090 RTX
- Make sure it has good power delivery for stability
- If you might add more GPUs later, ensure it has additional PCIe slots

**RAM**
- 32GB minimum for deep learning workloads (64GB preferred)
- DDR4-3200 or DDR5-4800+ depending on your motherboard/CPU choice

**Storage**
- Primary: 1TB NVMe SSD for OS and frequent datasets
- Secondary: 2-4TB HDD or SATA SSD for larger datasets and model storage

**Power Supply (PSU)**
- 850W+ Gold rated PSU minimum for a single 3090 RTX
- Consider 1000W+ if you plan to add another GPU later

**Cooling**
- Good airflow case with multiple fans
- CPU cooler: decent tower air cooler or 240mm AIO
- Additional case fans to help cool the 3090 RTX

**Case**
- Mid or full tower with good airflow
- Ensure it has enough clearance for your 3090 RTX
